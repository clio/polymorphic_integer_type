# PolymorphicIntegerType

Rails' polymorphic associations are pretty useful. The example they give to set it up looks like:

```ruby
class Picture < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :imageable, polymorphic: true
end

class Employee < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :pictures, as: :imageable
end

class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :pictures, as: :imageable
end
```

With a migration that looks like:

```ruby
class CreatePictures < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :pictures do |t|
      t.string  :name
      t.integer :imageable_id
      t.string  :imageable_type
      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

The problem with this approach is that `imageable_type` is a string (and by default it is 255 characters). This is a little ridiculous. For comparison, if we had a state machine with X states, would we describe the states with strings `"State1", "State2", etc` or would we just enumerate the state column and make it an integer? This gem will allow us to use an integer for the `imageable_type` column.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'polymorphic_integer_type'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install polymorphic_integer_type

## Usage

For the model where the `belongs_to` is defined, include `PolymorphicIntegerType::Extensions` and set the `polymorphic:` option to a hash that maps an integer stored in the database to the name of a Ruby class.

```ruby
class Picture < ActiveRecord::Base
  include PolymorphicIntegerType::Extensions

  belongs_to :imageable, polymorphic: {1 => "Employee", 2 => "Product"}
end
```

 Next, include `PolymorphicIntegerType::Extensions` into any of the models that point back to the polymorphic integer type association (e.g., `Picture#imageable`) and add a [polymorphic association using `as:`](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html#polymorphic-associations).

```ruby
class Employee < ActiveRecord::Base
  include PolymorphicIntegerType::Extensions

  has_many :pictures, as: :imageable
end

class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  include PolymorphicIntegerType::Extensions

  has_many :pictures, as: :imageable
end
```

### External mappings

You can also store polymorphic type mappings separate from your models. This should be loaded before the models. Putting it in an initializer is one way to do this (e.g., `config/initializers/polymorphic_type_mapping.rb`)

```ruby
PolymorphicIntegerType::Mapping.configuration do |config|
  config.add :imageable, {1 => "Employee", 2 => "Product" }
end
```

Note: The mapping here can start from whatever integer you wish, but I would advise not using 0. The reason being that if you had a new class, for instance `Avatar`, and also wanted to use this polymorphic association but forgot to include it in the mapping, it would effectively get `to_i` called on it and stored in the database. `"Avatar".to_i == 0`, so if your mapping included 0, this would create a weird bug.

### Migrating an existing association

If you want to convert a polymorphic association that is already a string, you'll need to set up a migration. (Assuming SQL for the time being, but this should be pretty straightforward.)

```ruby
class PictureToPolymorphicIntegerType < ActiveRecord::Migration

  def up
    change_table :pictures do |t|
      t.integer :new_imageable_type
    end

    execute <<-SQL
      UPDATE picture
      SET new_imageable_type = CASE imageable_type
                                 WHEN 'Employee' THEN 1
                                 WHEN 'Product' THEN 2
                               END
    SQL

    change_table :pictures, :bulk => true do |t|
      t.remove :imageable_type
      t.rename :new_imageable_type, :imageable_type
    end
  end

  def down
    change_table :pictures do |t|
      t.string :new_imageable_type
    end

    execute <<-SQL
      UPDATE picture
      SET new_imageable_type = CASE imageable_type
                                 WHEN 1 THEN 'Employee'
                                 WHEN 2 THEN 'Product'
                               END
    SQL

    change_table :pictures, :bulk => true do |t|
      t.remove :imageable_type
      t.rename :new_imageable_type, :imageable_type
    end
  end
end
```

Lastly, you will need to be careful of any place where you are doing raw SQL queries with the string (`imageable_type = 'Employee'`). They should use the integer instead.

## Setup

You'll need to have git and Ruby. Then get up and running with a few commands:

```bash
$ git clone ...
$ bundle install
$ vim spec/support/database.yml # Update username and password
$ bin/setup # Uses SQLite3 for testing (no additional setup required)
$ bundle exec rspec
```

## Database Compatibility

This gem works with any database supported by ActiveRecord (SQLite3, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.). 
The gem extends ActiveRecord's polymorphic associations and doesn't use database-specific features.

Development and testing uses SQLite3 for simplicity.
